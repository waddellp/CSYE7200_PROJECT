__Overview__<br>
Using publicly available data from the U.S. Geological Survey, create a tool to lookup historical data and forecast earthquakes. The tool will include a 10 year historical lookback and provide an interface with Google Maps to provide visualization of the information.

__Use Cases__
1.  Historical Lookup<br>A user enters latitude/longitude/radius and is provided with a Google Map / pins indicating earthquake events.
2.  Earthquake Forecast<br>A user enters an address and is provided with a percentage chance earthquakes at each magnitude.
3.  Top 10 Earthquake Hot Spots<br>A user enters a date range and is provided with the top ten locations around the globe for earthquake activity.
